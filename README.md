# Remote VR Eye Tracking Study

Bachelorthesis for remote VR Eye Tracking

Participants will be asked questions and the aim is to select answers with eye gaze by following the movement of the object (Smooth Pursuit).
- Eye tracking is enabled via SRanipal SDK for VIVE Pro Eye.
- Eye gaze data is collected via TobiiXR SDK.
- Correlation of moving object & eye gaze is calculated.
- Correlation of 0.9 has to be reached in order to select an answer with eye gaze.

After the experiment, an accuracy test will be executed:
- A white circle will be shown. Inside the white circle a black circle will be shown for 2 seconds (9x times).
- The participant has to gaze at the black dot.

Validity of data:
- 80% of data have to be valid.
- Eye gaze data is collected in a one second interval.
- SDPrecision & Accuracy have to reach a certain value.

After the accuracy test the participant will answer the demography & post study questions

Pressing the Quit button will close the application.
